            My educational background reflects a diverse and enriching academic journey. 
            I began with a strong foundation in elementary education, where I developed critical thinking and a passion for learning. 
            In high school, I excelled in subjects like Mathematics and Geography, which fueled my interest in pursuing higher education. 
            I am currently studying to obtain a degree in Software Engineering Bsc. from <a href="https://topfaith.edu.ng/">Topfaith University</a>, Mkpatak, where I engaged in rigorous coursework and hands-on projects. 
            My studies are complemented by occasional internships and research opportunities, enhancing my practical skills and knowledge. 
            This comprehensive educational experience has equipped me with a solid academic base and a readiness to tackle professional challenges.

                My work background encompasses a range of roles and industries, each contributing to my professional growth in one or two ways. 
                I started my career as a Sales attendant at Twice as Nice, where I honed my skills in Marketing and People skills. 
                This role provided me with some crucial skills, which I further applied in subsequent positions, including working as a Personal Assistant. 
                I also took on an internship at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/525system">525 SYSTEMS</a>, a computer company where i got the opportunity to learn from experts on-site.
                My experiences have equipped me with a diverse skill set, including people skills, communication skills, team building, 
                and marketing skills and a proven ability to adapt and excel in dynamic work environments.
